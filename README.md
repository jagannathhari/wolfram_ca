# Conway's Game of Life

## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. Despite its simple rules, the game can exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior.
